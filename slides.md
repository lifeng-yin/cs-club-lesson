# Intro


<p style="margin-top: 20px">How did you hear of dynamic programming? Perhaps you've just heard of it this second, or maybe you saw it on LeetCode, or maybe you're secretly a DP master. Well, let me tell you a secret - the name "Dynamic Programming" is misleading! <b class="font-800" style="opacity: 1">It's actually a problem-solving technique!</b> Here's how it works:</p>

<br>

- 1. Break the big, scary problem down into smaller, less scary, sub-problems.
- 2. Solve each sub-problem, breaking those down even smaller if you have to.
- 3. Store the results of each sub-problem after solving.
- 4. When solving a sub-problem that was solved and stored already, use that.

<br>
<br>

<h4> <b class="font-700">BIG IDEA:</b> <u>Reusing subproblems</u></h4>

# Difference between other algorithms

### Brute Force
- Loop/recur over all possible solutions
- Often called "naïve approach", simpler but slower

### Divide and Conquer
- Also splits a problem into sub-problems
- Sub-problems are independent, so no need for storing
- Used for different problems

### Greedy Algorithms
- Divides the problem into steps
- At each step, chooses the option that is best at the moment without worrying about the future
- Faster and more efficient, but won't always work

# Example Problem: Climbing Stairs



How many possible ways can you climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps, provided that you can only climb 1 or 2 steps at a time?

#### Example solution when `n = 8`:

`[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
<p style="font-size: 12px">(please don't do this in real life)</p>

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true">
